Structures

Race Simulator

On your mark, get set, GO! Using structures and the rest of your C knowledge we’ll be creating a race simulator.

First we’ll define our complex data types using structures. Then we’ll create some fun print functions to help update our audience. Finally, we’ll implement functions to help with the racing logic and start our race!
